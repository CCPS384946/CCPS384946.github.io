    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> In my personal lifes some of my goals could be to attend school everyday and maintain a very high GPA, another goal right now that I am working on is recovery my torn ACL, and last is to get stronger everyday in my weight lifting class. I am working on all of these goals by doing them everyday and putting progress in it everyday.
 Some values I need the most has to be my mentallity because that is the most important thing. Some short term goals that I would like to accomplish has to be to get good grades this grading period, and to gain more weight for Football. The most important character traits that values me the most has to be creative, driven, and hard working. </p>
